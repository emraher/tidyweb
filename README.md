`tidyweb` : Easily Install and Load Modern Web-Scraping Packages

Scraping the modern web requires having many tools in one’s toolbox and
the `tidyverse` only enables easy installation and loading of a few of
them. `tidyweb` bundles a more complete list of scraping tools to make
it easier to both install and use them.

`install.packages("tidyweb")` will get you a nice bundle of packages all
installed at once and `library(tidyweb)` will load a scraping “core” :
“`curl`”, “`jsonlite`”, “`httr`”, “`xml2`”, “`rvest`”, “`purrr`”,
“`dplyr`”, “`stringi`”, and “`splashr`”.
